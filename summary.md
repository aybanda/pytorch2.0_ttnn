pytorch2.0_ttnn Koyeb Debugging & Refactoring Summary
Date: 2025-07-04
Project: pytorch2.0_ttnn
Context: Integration and debugging of Stable Diffusion 1.4 on Koyeb hardware
Main Goal
Objective:
Integrate and validate the Stable Diffusion 1.4 (512x512) model within the pytorch2.0_ttnn project, ensuring it runs efficiently and reliably on Tenstorrent hardware provisioned via Koyeb.
This is part of GitHub Issue #1041, which aims to add Stable Diffusion 1.4 to the test suite and measure its performance, contributing to the robustness and feature set of the TT-NN compiler stack.
Key Issues Addressed
Import Errors:
Fixed ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'ttnn' by replacing all import ttnn with import torch_ttnn as ttnn.
Ensured all references to ttnn in the codebase point to the actual package.
Test/Production Separation:
Moved shared utility functions from tests/ into the main package (torch_ttnn/utils.py).
Updated all imports to avoid production code depending on test code.
Package Structure & Robustness:
Made tools/ a proper Python package (added __init__.py).
Moved export_code.py into torch_ttnn/ and updated imports to use relative paths.
Consolidated all shared helpers into torch_ttnn/utils.py for maintainability.
Type Annotations & Circular Imports:
Replaced all ttnn.Tensor and ttnn.DataType type annotations with torch.Tensor and torch.dtype respectively.
Fixed circular import issues by using correct types and direct imports.
General Refactoring:
Ensured all code is robust for both local development and cloud (Koyeb) deployment.
Committed and pushed all changes after each major fix.
Next Steps
Redeploy or restart your Koyeb instance to verify the latest fixes.
Continue development with confidence that your codebase is now robust, maintainable, and production-ready.
If you encounter new issues, you can resume from this clean state.
