## What We’ve Done So Far

1. **Identified the Issues:**
   - Issue #1041: Add Stable Diffusion 1.4 (512x512) to the test suite and measure performance.
   - Issue #1042: Add Stable Diffusion 3.5 medium (512x512) to the test suite and measure performance.

2. **Created Separate Branches:**  
   You’ve created separate branches for each issue to work in parallel or independently.

3. **Outlined a Plan:**  
   - Review Metal implementations for both models.
   - Check for any existing Stable Diffusion code or stubs in the current repo.
   - Plan where to place new model code and tests.
